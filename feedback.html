								<p><span class="feedback-title">Such a relaxing experience!</span> <span>I went to Craftsvilla with a few friends on a rainy Sunday, and it was honestly the highlight of my week. We tried mosaic art for the first time, and the staff were so kind and patient. Time flew by, and I left feeling calm and inspired. -Amelia, 29 </span></p></div>

								<p><span class="feedback-title">Perfect for a mindful break</span> <span>I booked the watercolor painting session during a stressful week at work, and it was exactly what I needed. The space is quiet and beautifully organized. I even framed my painting when I got home! -Jonas, 34</span></p></div>

                <img src="./Reviews/Lina.jpg" alt="A curly haired woman with a striped jacket smiling to the camera">
								<p><span class="feedback-title">Fun for all ages</span> <span>I brought my 8-year-old daughter for a clay workshop. She made a small pot and was so proud of it! It's rare to find something that both of us enjoy equally. We'll definitely be back to try jewelry making next time. -Lina, 37</span></p></div>

								<p><span class="feedback-title">Beautiful atmosphere and friendly people</span> <span>I'm not usually a "craft person", but I felt so welcome here. The staff really encourage creativity without pressure. I loved just sitting quietly, shaping clay and chatting over tea. -Eirik, 42</span></p></div>

								<p><span class="feedback-title">Loved the knitting corner!</span> <span>The crochet and knitting setup is cozy and well-equipped. Perfect for a rainy afternoon. It's also nice that you can bring extra material home and pay accordingly. -Mari, 25</span></p></div>

								<p><span class="feedback-title">Peaceful and inspiring</span> <span>Craftsvilla has such a warm and gentle atmosphere. You can come alone or with friends, and there's always something new to try. It's more than just a craft space â€” it's a little creative escape. -Thomas, 31</span></p></div>
